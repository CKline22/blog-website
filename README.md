Blog-website 
Is a blog website about the outdoors and travel. I like to travel and explore nature, which is my inspration for this website. The Navbar is functional and responsive. All the pages are linked together. React-bootstrap helped me greatly in making this website.


Start by cloning the git repository, with git clone. then cd "" into blog-website. Then cd "blog". Now it's time to install the npm packages. run npm install. After the modules are installed, run npm start. There is another README file in the blog folder with more information on how to use React and npm. After you run npm start, the react app will launch. 

This app uses:
React,
React-bootstrap,
React-dom,
React-router-dom,
Bootstrap,
html,
javascript,
css
